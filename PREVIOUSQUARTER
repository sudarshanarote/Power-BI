The PREVIOUSQUARTER function in DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is used to return a table that contains a set of dates
from the previous quarter relative to the given date context. This function is particularly useful in time intelligence calculations,
such as comparing metrics from the current quarter to the previous quarter.

Syntax

PREVIOUSQUARTER(<dates>)

Example Usage
Consider you have a date table named Calendar and a measure that calculates sales.
You can use PREVIOUSQUARTER to create a measure that calculates the sales from the previous quarter.

Example 1: Creating a Measure for Sales in the Previous Quarter
DAX
Copy code
Previous Quarter Sales = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM('Sales'[Amount]),
    PREVIOUSQUARTER('Calendar'[Date])
)

In this example:

SUM('Sales'[Amount]) calculates the total sales amount.
CALCULATE modifies the context to use dates from the previous quarter, as specified by PREVIOUSQUARTER('Calendar'[Date]).
