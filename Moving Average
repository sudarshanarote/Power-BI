Moving Average:-
        To calculate a moving average in Power BI, you can use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). A moving average smooths out data over a specified period,
making it easier to observe trends and patterns.

Example: Calculating a 3-Month Moving Average
Assuming you have a table called Sales with columns Date and Amount, hereâ€™s how you can calculate a 3-month moving average.

1. Create a Date Table
First, ensure you have a Date table in your model. If you don't have one, you can create it:

dax
Copy code
Date = CALENDAR(MIN(Sales[Date]), MAX(Sales[Date]))
2. Create Relationships
Ensure that the Date column in your Sales table is related to the Date column in your Date table.

3. Create the Moving Average Measure
You can now create a measure for the 3-month moving average:

DAX Cod:e- 

3MonthMovingAverage = 
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(Sales[Amount]),
    DATESINPERIOD(
        Date[Date],
        LASTDATE(Date[Date]),
        -3,
        MONTH
    )
)


Explanation of the Measure
CALCULATE: Evaluates an expression in a modified filter context.
AVERAGE(Sales[Amount]): Calculates the average of the Amount column in the Sales table.
DATESINPERIOD: Returns a table that contains a column of dates shifted by a specified number of intervals. In this case, it shifts by -3 months.
Date[Date]: The column of dates from the Date table.
LASTDATE(Date[Date]): The last date in the current context (usually the current row of a visual or table).
