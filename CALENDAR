The CALENDAR function in DAX is used to create a table with a single column of date values.
You specify a start date and an end date, and CALENDAR generates a continuous range of dates
between these two dates. This function is useful for creating a date table (also known as a calendar table)
for time intelligence calculations in Power BI, Power Pivot, and Analysis Services.

Syntax:-
CALENDAR(start_date, end_date)



Example 1:-
CALENDAR Demo 1 = 
CALENDAR(

    DATE(2020,01,01),
    DATE(2020,12,31)

)


Examples 2:-
CALENDAR Demo 2 = 
CALENDAR(
    DATE(YEAR(MIN('Calendar'[Transaction_Date])),1,1),
    DATE(YEAR(MAX('Calendar'[Transaction_Date])),12,31)
)
