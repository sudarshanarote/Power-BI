Rounding Functions:-
          Functions that can be used to round the values to different levels of precision.

ROUND:
The ROUND function rounds a number to the specified number of digits.

Syntax: ROUND(<number>, <num_digits>)
  
number: The number you want to round.
  num_digits: The number of digits to which you want to round.
        If num_digits is greater than 0, the number is rounded to the specified decimal places.
        If num_digits is 0, the number is rounded to the nearest integer.
        If num_digits is less than 0, the number is rounded to the left of the decimal point.


Example 1:
Rounding 2.15 up to one decimal place:
Result = ROUND(2.15, 1)  // Expected: 2.2

Example 2:
Rounding 21.5 to one decimal place to the left of the decimal point:
Result = ROUND(21.5, -1)  // Expected: 20

ROUNDDOWN:
The ROUNDDOWN function rounds a number down, toward zero.
Example:
Result = ROUNDDOWN(3.8)  // Expected: 3

ROUNDUP:
The ROUNDUP function rounds a number up, away from zero.
Example:
Result = ROUNDUP(3.2)  // Expected: 4

TRUNC:
The TRUNC function truncates a number to an integer by removing the decimal or fractional part.
Example:
Result = TRUNC(4.7)  // Expected: 4

FLOOR and CEILING:
The FLOOR function rounds a number down to the nearest integer or multiple of significance.
The CEILING function rounds a number up to the nearest integer or multiple of significance.
Example:
Floor Result = FLOOR(5.3)  // Expected: 5
Ceiling Result = CEILING(5.3)  // Expected: 6

Remember, these rounding functions are useful for adjusting numbers based on specific requirements
