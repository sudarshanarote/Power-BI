SCALAR Functions:-
            Scalar functions returns a single value, rather than aa column or table. common examples include aggregation, conversion, rounding and logical function.
        1) Aggregation Functions
        2) Information Functions
        3) Logical Functions
        4) Rounding Functions
        5) Conversion Functions


In DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), we have two main types of functions: scalar functions and tabular functions. Let’s dive into each of them:

Scalar Functions:
            Scalar functions return a single value. This value can be of any data type, such as numeric, date, text, or boolean.

Aggregation Functions:
            These functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single result.
Examples:
    SUM: Calculates the sum of a column or expression.
    AVERAGE: Computes the average of a column or expression.
    MIN and MAX: Find the minimum and maximum values.
    COUNT: Counts the number of rows in a table or column.


Information Functions:
            These functions provide information about data or expressions.
Examples:
    ISBLANK: Checks if a value is blank (empty).
    ISNUMBER: Determines if a value is numeric.
    ISINSCOPE: Indicates whether a measure is being evaluated within a specific filter context.


Logical Functions:
            Logical functions return a boolean (TRUE or FALSE) result based on conditions.
Examples:
    IF: Returns one value if a condition is true, and another value if false.
    AND and OR: Combine multiple conditions.
    NOT: Negates a boolean value.


Rounding Functions:
          These functions allow you to round numbers to a specified precision.
Examples:
    ROUND: Rounds a number to the nearest integer.
    ROUNDUP: Rounds up to the nearest integer.
    ROUNDDOWN: Rounds down to the nearest integer.


Conversion Functions:
            Conversion functions change the data type of a value.
Examples:
    VALUE: Converts a text representation of a number to an actual number.
    TEXT: Converts a value to text.
    DATEVALUE: Converts a date text to a date value.

Misuse of Functions:
          Be cautious not to use a function in a place where it doesn’t make sense. For example:
          Using a scalar function to build a calculated table.
          Using a tabular function to return the main result of a DAX measure.


Remember, understanding the distinction between scalar and tabular functions is essential for effective DAX modeling.
