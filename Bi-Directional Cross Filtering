Bidirectional cross-filtering in Power BI is a feature that allows filters to flow in both directions between tables in a data model.
To understand this concept from the basics, let's break it down:

1. Data Model in Power BI
In Power BI, a data model consists of tables that are connected through relationships. These relationships are typically defined by key columns that link tables together.
For instance, a common scenario would be connecting a Sales table to a Products table through a ProductID column.

2. Relationships in Power BI
When you connect two tables in Power BI, you establish a relationship. By default, these relationships have a single direction of filter propagation.
This means that if you filter the data in one table, the related data in the connected table will also be filtered, but not the other way around.

Single-directional filtering: Filter flows from one table to the other in one direction.
For example, if you filter the Products table to show only "Product A", the Sales table will also only show sales related to "Product A". However,
filtering the Sales table won't impact the Products table.

3. Bidirectional Cross-Filtering
Bidirectional cross-filtering allows the filter to flow in both directions between two tables.
This means that if you apply a filter on one table, it will not only filter the related table but also allow the related table to filter back the original table.

Bidirectional filtering: Filter flows in both directions between connected tables.
For example, if you have bidirectional cross-filtering between Products and Sales:

Filtering Products will filter Sales.
Filtering Sales will also filter Products.

4. When to Use Bidirectional Cross-Filtering
Complex data models: When you have complex data models with multiple related tables, bidirectional cross-filtering can make it easier to manage filters and relationships.
Data consistency: It helps in scenarios where the data in one table should always be consistent with the related data in another table.
Relationships involving fact tables: It is useful when dealing with relationships between fact tables (e.g., Sales, Inventory) and dimension tables (e.g., Products, Customers).

5. How to Enable Bidirectional Cross-Filtering
In Power BI, you can enable bidirectional cross-filtering when creating or editing a relationship between two tables:

Go to the Model view.
Double-click on the relationship line between the tables.
In the Edit Relationship dialog box, choose the Cross filter direction option as Both.

6. Considerations
Performance: Enabling bidirectional cross-filtering can have an impact on performance, especially with large datasets.
Data ambiguity: It can sometimes create ambiguity in the data model, leading to unexpected results.

7. Visual Impact
When using bidirectional cross-filtering in reports, visuals that pull data from related tables will reflect filters applied on any of the connected tables,
providing more flexible and dynamic report interactions.
