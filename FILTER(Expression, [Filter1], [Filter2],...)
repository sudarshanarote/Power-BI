FILTER(Expression, [Filter1], [Filter2],...) :-
          Filter is both a table function and an Iterator.
          Often used to reduce the number of rows to scan.


The FILTER function in DAX allows you to create a subset of a table by evaluating a Boolean expression for each row
and returning only the rows that satisfy the condition. It is a powerful tool for data filtering.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

Syntax:
FILTER(<table>, <filter_expression>)

Parameters:
<table>: The table to be filtered (can also be an expression that results in a table).
<filter_expression>: A Boolean expression to be evaluated for each row.

Example: Suppose you have a sales table with columns for product names, sales amounts, and regions.
You want to filter out sales in the United States:

Non-USA Sales = CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]),
    FILTER('Sales', RELATED('SalesTerritory'[SalesTerritoryCountry]) <> "United States")
)

In this example, the expression filters out all rows that belong to the United States sales territory.
