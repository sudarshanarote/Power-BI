CALCULATE:-
        Evaluates a given Expresion or formula under a set of defined filters.


Expression:
The expression you provide to CALCULATE is essentially a measure. It can include functions like SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, or any other DAX function that returns a value.
For example, if you want to calculate the total sales amount, your expression might be SUM(Sales[Sales Amount]).

Filter Context Modification:
The magic of CALCULATE lies in its ability to modify the filter context in which the expression is evaluated.
You can add or overwrite filters on specific columns or tables to control how your measure behaves.
This is incredibly useful for creating dynamic calculations based on different conditions.


Filters:
You can include one or more filters as additional parameters to CALCULATE.
Filters can be:
Boolean filter expressions: These evaluate to TRUE or FALSE. They can reference columns from a single table and follow certain rules.
Table filter expressions: These apply a table object as a filter. You can use functions like FILTER to create complex filter conditions.
Filter modifier functions: These allow you to do more than just add filters. Examples include REMOVEFILTERS, ALL, ALLEXCEPT, and KEEPFILTERS.

Examples:
Suppose you want to calculate the total sales amount for red products:

Total Red Sales = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Sales Amount]), Products[Color] = "Red")

Here, the filter on the Color column is added to the existing filter context.

Remember:
CALCULATE is a fundamental function in DAX, enabling dynamic calculations based on filters.
Itâ€™s like adjusting the lens through which you view your data, allowing you to focus on specific aspects while ignoring others.
