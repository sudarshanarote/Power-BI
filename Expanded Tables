Expanded Tables:-
            An xpanded Table consist of base table (which is visible to the users),along
with the columns from any related table connected via a 1-to-1 or many-to-1 relationship.

Expanded Tables in the models always go from the Many side to one side of the relationship.
      1) Expanded tables contain all the columns of the original table plus all the columns on the onne side.
      2) Understanding expanded tables is useful because it provides a clear understanding of how filer context propages in DAX queries.
      3) Once a filter is applied to a column, all expanded tables containing that column are also filtered.


In DAX, an expanded table refers to a table that includes additional columns or rows based on 
relationships or calculations. These expanded tables are created dynamically during query execution
or when evaluating expressions. Here are some scenarios where expanded tables come into play:

Filter Context Expansion:
When you create a measure or calculated column, DAX evaluates it within a specific filter context.
The filter context includes filters applied by slicers, row-level security, and other factors.
DAX automatically expands the filter context to include related tables based on active relationships.
For example, if you have a sales table related to a date table, DAX expands the filter context to include date-related information.

Row Context Expansion:
When iterating over rows (e.g., using iterators like SUMX or FILTER), DAX creates an expanded table.
Each row in the original table corresponds to multiple rows in the expanded table.
The expanded table includes additional columns from related tables.
For instance, if you iterate over products and calculate sales for each product, DAX expands the context to include related sales data.

Expanded Columns:
DAX expressions can reference columns from related tables.
These columns are considered part of the expanded table.
For example, if you create a calculated column that computes the total sales for each customer, it may reference columns from both the customer and sales tables.

Expanded Rows:
When using iterators like SUMX, DAX iterates over rows and creates an expanded table.
Each row in the original table results in multiple rows in the expanded table.
The expanded rows include all related rows based on active relationships.
This expansion allows you to perform calculations across related data.
