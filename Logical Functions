Logical Functions:-
            Functions for returing information about values in a conditional expression.


IF:
The IF function evaluates a condition and returns one value if the condition is true, and another value if false.
Syntax: IF(<condition>, <value_if_true>, <value_if_false>)

      <condition>: A logical expression.
      <value_if_true>: The result when the condition is true.
      <value_if_false>: The result when the condition is false.

Example: To categorize sales as “High” or “Low” based on a threshold:
Sales Category = IF(Sales[SalesAmount] > 1000, "High", "Low")

AND and OR:
    The AND function checks if all conditions are true.
    The OR function checks if at least one condition is true.
Example:
Is High Value Sale? = AND(Sales[SalesAmount] > 1000, Sales[Region] = "West")

NOT:
    The NOT function negates a boolean value.
Example:
Is Not Cancelled? = NOT(Sales[IsCancelled])

TRUE/FALSE:
      These are constants representing boolean values.
Example:
Is Active Customer? = Sales[IsActive] = TRUE()

SWITCH:
      The SWITCH function is like a multi-condition IF statement.
      It evaluates a series of conditions and returns a value based on the first true condition.
Example:
Product Category = SWITCH(Products[CategoryID], 1, "Electronics", 2, "Clothing", "Other")

COALESCE:
      The COALESCE function returns the first non-blank value from a list of expressions.
Example:
Preferred Contact = COALESCE(Customer[Email], Customer[Phone], Customer[Address])

Remember, logical functions help you make decisions and create dynamic calculations in DAX.
