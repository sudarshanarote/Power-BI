Aggregation Functions:-
              Functions that can be used to dynamically aggregate values within a column.


SUM:
Calculates the sum of a column or expression.
Example: If you have a sales table with a column named SalesAmount, you can find the total sales using:
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[SalesAmount])

AVERAGE:
Computes the average of a column or expression.
Example: To find the average order quantity, you can use:
Average Quantity = AVERAGE(Sales[OrderQuantity])

MIN and MAX:
Find the minimum and maximum values in a column.
Examples:
Minimum sales amount:
Min Sales Amount = MIN(Sales[SalesAmount])

Maximum order date:
Max Order Date = MAX(Sales[OrderDate])

COUNT:
Counts the number of rows in a table or column.
Example: To count the number of products in your inventory, use:
Product Count = COUNT(Products[ProductID])

COUNTA:
Similar to COUNT, but includes non-blank values only.
Useful for counting non-empty cells.
Example: Count non-blank customer names:
Non-Blank Customers = COUNTA(Customer[CustomerName])

DISTINCTCOUNT:
Counts the number of distinct (unique) values in a column.
Example: Count unique product categories:
Unique Categories = DISTINCTCOUNT(Products[Category])

PRODUCT:
Multiplies all values in a column.
Example: Calculate the total revenue (product of quantity and price):
Total Revenue = PRODUCT(Sales[Quantity], Sales[UnitPrice])


Remember, aggregation functions are essential for summarizing data and creating meaningful insights.
