DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) variables are a powerful feature that can enhance your DAX formulas in several ways. Letâ€™s explore how they work and their benefits:

Variables (VAR) are DAX expression which can be reused multiple times within a query, and are commonly used for two key purposes:-
1) Readability:- Variable make complex code more human readable.
2) Performance:- Variables are only evaluated once no matter how often they are used within a query.

Improve Performance:
When you have complex expressions that involve repeating calculations, using variables can significantly improve performance.
Instead of evaluating the same expression multiple times, you can store the result in a variable and reuse it within your formula.
For example, consider calculating year-over-year (YoY) sales growth. The initial formula might look like this:

Sales YoY Growth % = DIVIDE(
    ([Sales] - CALCULATE([Sales], PARALLELPERIOD('Date'[Date], -12, MONTH))),
    CALCULATE([Sales], PARALLELPERIOD('Date'[Date], -12, MONTH))
)

By using a variable, we can make it more efficient:

Sales YoY Growth % = VAR SalesPriorYear = CALCULATE([Sales], PARALLELPERIOD('Date'[Date], -12, MONTH))
RETURN DIVIDE(([Sales] - SalesPriorYear), SalesPriorYear)

Improve Readability:
Well-named variables make your formulas easier to read and understand.
In the improved formula above, the variable name SalesPriorYear clearly indicates its purpose.

Simplify Debugging:
Variables allow you to test specific parts of your formula.
Temporarily comment out the main expression and return only the variable value for debugging:

Sales YoY Growth % = VAR SalesPriorYear = CALCULATE([Sales], PARALLELPERIOD('Date'[Date], -12, MONTH))
RETURN
--DIVIDE(([Sales] - SalesPriorYear), SalesPriorYear)
SalesPriorYear

Reduce Complexity:
In earlier versions of DAX, variables were not supported, and complex expressions had to use functions like EARLIER or EARLIEST.
Variables allow you to break down logic into smaller steps, making your formulas more manageable.
Remember, DAX variables are a valuable tool for creating efficient, readable, and maintainable formulas. If you have any specific use cases or need further clarification, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
